# flake8panel
A Flake8 checker panel for Wing IDE that verifies whether code is compliant with various tools invoked by Flake8.

This panel is known to work with Wing IDE v6.

## Issues

* When using pyenv, the Python version for flake8 must match the Python version used by Wing IDE.

### Notes

Code is based on prior work by Stefan Tjarks: https://bitbucket.org/stj/pep8panel/overview.
